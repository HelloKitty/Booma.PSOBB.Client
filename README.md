# Booma.PSOBB.Client

A Unity3D client implementation of the libraries in [Booma.Proxy](https://www.github.com/HelloKitty/Booma.Proxy).

It is an opensource, extendable and PSOBB compatible custom client.

## How and Why

The PSOBB client is closedsource, difficult to modify and does not allow the content to be easily extended. An opensource implementation solves these issues and potentially unlocks a new era of PSOBB content.

## How to Use

You will need:
- Unity 2017.1.0.f3

## Builds

Unity Cloud: [Build #1](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/WJ-9ZjLcnG/)
